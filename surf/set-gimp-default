# This sets GIMP to use its default hotkeys and layout
## This is intended to revert GIMP settings after set-gimp-pscc was used to make GIMP more familiar to people who know Photoshop

# DISCLAIMER: This is NOT Photoshop and has no intention of copying or pretending to be Photoshop or Adobe!

# Thanks: Michael & doctormo
## Love you Michael Bender, DO MORE VIDEOS!

## Smart idea, a real need, Photoshop is somewhat of a standard "mo". Thanks, doctormo!

# How to use:
## set-gimp-default


# Check to make sure this not run as sudo or root
if [ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]; then
echo "Dude. Don't change this folder as root. None of that sudo stuff here."; exit 22
fi

# Check if Vrk installed on machine
if [ ! -d /var/local/vrk ]; then
echo "First, run install-vubuntu-vrkstation for this user. See README.md"; exit 22
fi

# Check if Vrk installed to user
if [ ! -f ~/.vrk/configs/stationinfo ]; then
echo "First, run install-vubuntu-vrkstation for this user. See README.md"; exit 22
fi

# Disclaimer
echo "I understand that:
- This is not Photoshop and never was.
- Pretending to be Photoshop or Adobe would be wrong and bad and no one here is doing that.
- \"Photoshop\" or \"CC\" or \"Ps\" or \"CreativeCloud\" here, when referred to, mean the awesome, familiar layout and hotkeys used by the great people at Adobe, not any actual product itself.
- I'm not a pirate and if I ever see pirating, I'll let everyone know, including inkVerb at http://vubuntu.info

- This will change my layout back to the way GIMP originally designed.

Type \"yes\" if you agree and want to set Ps/CC -like styles in GIMP for this user.

# Set it back
rm -rf .gimp-2.8
