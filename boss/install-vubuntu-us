# This installs Vubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Studio
## Note: Installing StudioLite first is a heavy overlap, but it puts options first, then makes the Ubuntu Studio install take less time.
## This runs: install-grfx, install-vubuntu-studiolite, install-ubuntustudio, and install-vubuntu-desktop
## Prerequesite: Vrkâ„¢ must be installed

# How to use:
## sudo install-vubuntu-us


# Set user
VRK_USER=${SUDO_USER}

# Check if Vrk installed on this machine
if [ ! -f /var/local/vrk/machineinfo ]; then
echo "Install Vrk on this machine first. See README.md"
exit 22; fi

# Check if installed
if [ ! -f /home/${VRK_USER}/.vrk/configs/stationinfo ]; then
echo "Install Vrk first. See README.md"
exit 22; fi

# Check to make sure this is run as sudo, but not run by root
## If root or sudo
if [ "$(id -u)" = "0" ]; then
## If sudo is NOT present
 if [ -z "${SUDO_COMMAND}" ]; then
echo "Run this as a sudoer sudo, not as root. You'll have to exit root and perhaps re-login as the sudoer. Then...
like this:
sudo install-vubuntu-us
"
exit 22; fi; fi
## If sudo is NOT present
if [ -z "${SUDO_COMMAND}" ]; then
echo "Run this as a sudoer sudo, not merely as a sudoer.
like this:
sudo install-vubuntu-us
"
exit 22; fi
