Vrk from inkVerb (inkisaverb.com, vubuntu.info, verb.ink) is free to distribute via GPLv3. But...

Some redistributed Themes and Icons may have OpenSource licenses other than GPLv3. These licences are described in the vubuntu/ti/licenses folder. These licenses should be open-source, but may be more restrictive. themes and icons in the vubuntu/ti folder are not native to Vrk and should be considered as open-source contributions not necessarily under the direct preview of the GPLv3 license. Note them carefully and assume responsibility when copying.
