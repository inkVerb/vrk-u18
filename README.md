# BETA:
## This has only been tested with Xfce (Xubuntu), Unity (Ubuntu, legacy but still working for the 16.04 LTS), GNOME, KDE, Cinnamon, and Mate, with _ubuntu, Linuxmint, and Manjaro
## While I can get Docky to load at startup, I still can't get it's .gconf settings to load to make it best for each environment.
### ALL REPOS MUST WORK!!!
*If you get "E:" error messages after running* `sudo apt update` *then you need to go to Software & Updates > Other Software, and then remove whatever ppa repo is in the error message.*

*If you have errors in `sudo apt update` then Vrk will not install because your system just has too many loose bolts. Button up first, then "get to Vrk". (Did you see what I did there?)*

- Read the README.md before reporting problems! !! Seriously.
- Files in boss/ and surf/ have their own purpose and instructions at the top of the files. READ THEM!
- HAVE FUN! !! Seriously.

# What is Vrk?
inkVerb's Vrk app is a collection of simple scripts that sets up a useful configuration for main Ubuntu distros

## How to Install
- Breeze through this README.md first!!
- Put "vrk" in your home folder
- Open the terminal (Ctrl + Alt + T)
cd /vrk/inst
chmod +x setupvrk
sudo ./setupvrk
- Answer the two simple folder questions carefully
- Done! :-)

## Where stuff is
- Your "Work" folder (whatever you set in setupvrk) syncs your docs in your cloud folder (whatever you set in setupvrk).
- If you're a LinuxNOOB, you should know that `~/` is a universal wildcard for your "home" folder, literally at `/home/YOU/`. This is the folder you almost always open to in Ctrl + Alt + T = Terminal or the fild browser.
- In the hidden folder `~/.vrk` you'll see the goodie at your disposal:
1. `boards` has the "Surfers" you can use, tools to manage your system. Most of these are global and you can run them from any terminal.
   *Colorful linked files are "Bosses" that install and change things and require sudo. Run them with:*
   `cd .vrk/boards`
   `sudo ./WHATEVER-BOSS`
2. `configs` has stuff you only want to touch if you don't mind messing up everything and really want to learn how Vrk works.
3. `donjon` has stuff that Bosses need, generally don't mess. But, there are some hidden goodies in there if you aren't afraid of the dragons.
4. `go` has your quick scripts that let you SSH your way into remote servers very quickly and control them from the command line.
   *Add "Go Surfers" by following the instructions in the "Go Surfers" instructions.*

## Go Surfers
*Go Surfers are an awesome say to access FTP/FileZilla and SSH/Terminal access to web servers.*

### Here is the Go Surfer config hierarchy tree
*(These Surfers configure the Go Surfers)*
*(ssh-add-all runs all of them... except ssh-guake-on, which you probably don't want anyway.)*

ssh-add-all                   # takes all SSH credentials and adds them everywhere, even creating an SSH key if it doesn't already exist

  ?ssh-craft-key              # creates an SSH key that can be uploaded to a server for no-password login; included in ssh-add-all  IF the key doesn't already exist

     ssh-add-goguake          # creates gosurfer and adds him to Guake-Indicator

       ssh-add-gosurfer       # creates a gosurfer

       ssh-add-guake          # adds gosurfer to Guake-Indicator menu

     ssh-filezilla-addkey     # adds gosurfer and SSH key to FileZilla

     ssh-add-key              # uses password to login and upload an SSH key to a server for future no-password login

  ssh-guake-indicator-on      # sets guake-indicator menu to load at startup

ssh-guake-on                  # sets guake-indicator menu to stop loading at starup and guake instead

## Different installs
- setupvrk sets up Vrk for the machine (computer): folder and cloud structure, templates, and the ability for other Vrk tools to work
- install-vubuntu-vrkstation installs config files and structure for a specific user (automatically initiated by setupvrk, but only for that user)
- install-vubuntu installs apps and Vubuntu desktop settings & wallpapers

##Ubuntu distros, "Vubuntu Desktop" and Vrk goals
- Vrk adds a special folder configuration: Documents becomes a folder synced in your choice cloud, along with the new "Work" folder.
- ...a simple collection of Templates most may find useful, which syncs to your choice cloud, except in Xfce.
- ...several small "Surfers" (bash scripts) that help connect your computer to a VPS via SSH, and works particularly well with a Verberâ„¢ server.
- Vubuntu Desktop is a kind of "should-be out-of-the-box" configuration for Ubuntu intermediate power-users. The purpose is to bring some continuity for common desktop settings across platforms, setting them up quickly and somewhat standardized so that people can get to work rather than spend hours configuring all the same settings at every fresh Ubuntu install, without interfering with settings or functions that users enjoy in different desktop environments. Eg. Kate is the default editor in KDE, Gedit in all others, but this can be changed either way with set-kate-edit and set-gedit-edit.
- Target distros include: GNOME, Mate, and Xubuntu (Xfce); Kubuntu (KDE) and Mint (incl Cinnamon, Mate, KDE, Xfce) are tested for compatability, but second priotiry since Kubuntu lacks command line control and stability. Lubuntu and Edubuntu aren't tested.
- Ubuntu Studio is intended for compatability, but not tested since install .iso images sometimes have trouble. That said, Ubuntu Studio integration is top priority. Wherever Vrk's roadmap finds a conflict with a distro and the ubuntustudio repo packages, Vrk adopts scripts to "trump" settings structures and "Make Ubuntu Studio Work Again."
- Arch and Red Hat (Fedora/CentOS) are not goals because they lack Debian, Arch is already labor intensive by definition and purpose and thus contrary to scope, and Red Hat already has their own thing going.
- Vrk works as close to Ubuntu and Debian cores as possible. The main difference is a GNOME/MATE/Xfce/Unity/KDE check for settings, such as dconf, gsettings, and xquery... or sed and cp for KDE.
- The purpose of Vrk was, initially, to bring a lite version of Ubuntu Studio to your choice of Ubuntu distro. Then it grew.

## Folder configuration (awesomeness, read fully)
- Vrk makes used of Documents, the folder no one uses, by making it a synced folder accessible outside your cloud folder.
- Vrk creates a new "Work" folder for that misc. stuff we use all the time, but don't know where to put. You give it your own name, in this documentation it is called "Work".
- Vrk asks for your primary cloud folder name in which to sync Documents, Templates, and your Work folder; it can be anything.
- These three synced folders move to your cloud and link back to your home folder.
- Vrk installs a set of templates the first time, but won't if it detects a existing Templates folder in your cloud on future installs. Install original Vrk templates anytime via install-vrktemplates.
- Media and Public folders don't move to your cloud because those are usually intended to be local and manged by the user
- Vrk has back-end "machine names" such as VRK_DESKTOP_DIR to match XDG_DESKTOP_DIR, via ~/.vrk/configs/lang/stationuser-dirs_CURRENT
- Vrk vrk adds two machine names VRK_WORK_DIR (Work folder) and VRK_CLOUD_DIR (primary cloud folder) via ~/.vrk/configs/stationinfo
- Vrk changes all folders from whatever language into English, for programming ease.
- If the user's initially installed folders are non-English, Vrk creates ~/MyLang/ and with links to all home folders in the original language, for user reference. English folder names are easier for coding.

## Names
- Vrk's various scripts that do different jobs are called "Surfers". Surfers that require sudo are called "Bosses", but aren't available to non-sudoers.
- A machine with Vrk installed is called a "Vrk Station"
- In other areas of the inkVerb universe, you will see Knights, Serfs, Yoemen, Donjons, and even Dragons. Vrk Stations are for "Surfing" the cloud kingdom and are more relaxed. Verber and Inker from inkVerb are a little more serious as they manage castles in the cloud.

## Integration
- A Vrk Station is intended to do whatever work on your computer, but also effectively control cloud servers.
- Vrk has Surfers to create and add SSH credentials and keys to guake-indicator, FileZilla, a remote server, and Vrk's "gosurf" ssh script, fully via back-end command line.
  - Use: craft-sshkey, add-sshall
  - Surfers are copied to ~/.vrk/boards/
  - Bosses are linked to ~/.vrk/boards/ (only for sudoers) and so they appear as a different color when using "ls" in the terminal.
- A Vrk Station can control many clouds quickly and easily, but also has integration with OpenSource "Verber" servers, see the inkVerb GitHub project and http://verb.ink

## Back-end
- When you install, the vrk "core" folder will move to /var/local/, then creates a .vrk folder in your home withconfigs and links to the core.
- You will need to copy vrk to the home folder each time you want to install it for a user. It's somewhat a one-user-machine app, but can work for others.
- To update Vrk, run the updatevrk Surfer.

## Vubuntu
- Surfers can install different apps quickly and easily, such as install-vubuntu, a lite Ubuntu Studio with common extras, including editors, browsers, dekstop tools.
- installvubuntu runs apt-get install scripts in batches, just in case Internet is unstable. If you get cut-off, you should be able to start over and pick up close to where you lost Internet.
- If you want a full Ubuntu Studio install from the command line, using installvubuntu first will get those EULA and other interactive questions done first and make the rest of ubuntu-studio a lot faster.
- Included with installvubuntu is Docky with a rollup of several common apps and a transparent dock configuration, some normal settings for Guake, and the like.
- Vubuntu is a long-term plan as a possible distro, but aims to work as a seamless add-on for the main Ubuntu distro desktops. If ever a distro, it owuld aim for easy desktop environment changes.
- Note, installvubuntu includes Chris' Dynamic Compressor plugin for Audacity. We remember.
